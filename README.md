## **Collect Headline Data from Refinitiv EIKON.**

There is a nice article by Jason Ramchadani talking about how to set proper query to pull out news headline data from Refinitiv EIKON, you can access [here](https://developers.refinitiv.com/en/article-catalog/article/introduction-news-sentiment-analysis-eikon-data-apis-python-example).

Using Refinitiv API is quite challenging because there is not enough documentation for that and also there are a lot of customisation. For retrieving the headline news we can use `get_news_headline` function with these arguments you can pass on:

- **query**:	
string, optional. Search criteria for the news headlines The query can contain RIC codes, company names, country names and operators (AND, OR, NOT, IN, parentheses and quotes for explicit searchâ€¦). Tip: Append 'R:' in front of RIC names to improve performance. Default: Top News written in English
- **count**:	
int, optional. The maximum number of headlines to retrieve. Value Range: [1-100]. Default: 10

- **date_from**:	
string. Beginning of date range. String format is:'%Y-%m-%dT%H:%M:%S'. e.g. 2016-01-20T15:04:05.

- **date_to**:	
string. End of date range. String format is: '%Y-%m-%dT%H:%M:%S'. e.g. "2016-01-20T15:04:05".

- **raw_output**:	
boolean. Set this parameter to True to get the data in json format if set to False, the function will return a data frame The default value is False

- **debug**:	
boolean. If this parameter is set to True, the json request and response are printed.


To construct well writen query for the news headline we can head up to **news monitor** write your criteria on the search bar, copy and paste the result to your jupyter notebook.
